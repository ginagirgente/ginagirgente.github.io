            My capstone topic is not yet finalized.

            <h3>Virginia Tech</h3>
            I engaged in three undergraduate research projects throughout two of the three years I spent at Virginia
            Tech. I presented two at the Dennis Dean Undergraduate Research Conference, was funded through a fellowship
            for one, and the third has been published in a subjournal of Nature.

                <b>Research in the geosciences:</b> paleocology, paleoclimatology, biogeography, stable isotope analysis<br>
                This research was done under Dr. Rachel Reid and Dr. Lisa Kennedy. I began as a geoscience technician for 
                one year, then worked with my professors to create a sub-project that I could do individual research with for 
                credit. It was presented at the Dennis Dean conference. My individual research information is below: 
                
                <p>Title: Reconstructing the Past Environment around Mountain Lake, Giles County, VA</p>

                Abstract: Very few natural lakes occur in the Appalachian Mountains, one of the most biologically diverse 
                regions in the temperate world, but Mountain Lake in Giles County, Virginia, is an exception. Sediments 
                accumulating on the lake bed provide an opportunity to study past climate and environment in this high 
                conservation value region. Paleoenvironmental records are needed in particular to inform estimates of 
                the past extent of grassland habitats, as these habitats are especially threatened today. This research 
                uses carbon isotope values measured in sediment cores collected from Mountain Lake to reconstruct past 
                vegetation dynamics in the area around the lake. Plant carbon isotope values are driven primarily by 
                their photosynthetic pathways with C3 plants (most trees and shrubs) having considerably lower values 
                than C4 plants, which are primarily grasses (averaging -27‰ vs -12‰, respectively). Decreases in lake 
                sediment d13C values, therefore, provide evidence for more forest-like vegetation in the surrounding 
                area, whereas increases suggest more grassland. We collected a 370 cm long sediment core from Mountain 
                Lake, which dates to 1746 cal BP at 326 cm depth. We then extracted organic carbon from the sediments 
                (mostly dead plant matter) for isotopic analysis, which was completed in the Stable Isotope Lab in the 
                Department of Geosciences.  d13C values measured between -28 and -27‰, suggesting that the area has 
                been forested since at least 2,000 years before present.<br>

                <b>Research in future urban extent:</b> GIS, linear regression, coding in R, ArcGIS, change matrices<br>
                This research was done under Dr. Yang Shao for credit. It was presented at the Dennis Dean conference
                and funded by a fellowship from the College of Natural Resources and Environement at Virginia Tech.

                <p>Title: Urban Growth Modeling for Selected Coastal Cities of the Eastern U.S.</p>

                Abstract: Coastal ecosystems are under increasing pressure from population and urban growth,
                 sea level rise, and climate change. Reliable models of these changes can help land/water 
                 managers and decision-makers plan for and mitigate undesirable outcomes to better meet 
                 societal needs. Focusing on the urban growth component, the main objective of this research 
                 is to develop a simulation model for coastal urban areas with meaningful interpretation and 
                 inference. Land cover products from NOAA C-CAP and NLCDs are used to identify forest-urban 
                 and agricultural-urban change locations from 1992-2019. A number of geographical and social 
                 variables are assembled to model urban changes using logistic regression model. These 
                 explanatory variables include elevation, slope, distance to road, distance to existing urban, 
                 and population density. Using the resultant urban change probabilities from logistic regression
                  models, we further evaluate various growth scenarios such as business as usual, growth as 
                  planned, and resilient growth for 2020-2050. The model development initially focuses on 
                  Hampton Roads Metropolitan Statistical Area, VA. However, the modeling framework and data 
                  requirement is generally applicable and transferable to other coastal cities in the eastern
                    US. Results from urban growth simulation models can be combined with future sea level rise
                     scenarios for more in-depth analysis. <br>

                <b>Research in Generative AI:</b> GIS, quantitative methods in GIS, GeoDa, ArcGIS, coding in R, ChatGPT<br>
                This research was done with Dr. Junghwan Kim and Carmen Atkins, a PhD student at Virginia Tech.
                The research information is below: 
                
                <p>Title: Generative AI tools can enhance climate literacy but must be checked for biases and inaccuracies</p>

                Abstract: In the face of climate change, climate literacy is becoming increasingly important. With wide access to generative 
                AI tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, we explore the potential of AI platforms for ordinary citizens asking climate literacy questions. 
                Here, we focus on a global scale and collect responses from ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on climate change-related hazard prompts over 
                multiple iterations by utilizing the OpenAI’s API and comparing the results with credible hazard risk indices. We find a general sense 
                of agreement in comparisons and consistency in ChatGPT over the iterations. GPT-4 displayed fewer errors than GPT-3.5. Generative AI 
                tools may be used in climate literacy, a timely topic of importance, but must be scrutinized for potential biases and inaccuracies 
                moving forward and considered in a social context. Future work should identify and disseminate best practices for optimal use across 
                various generative AI tools. <br><br>
